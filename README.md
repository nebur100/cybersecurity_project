# 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Web Pentesting Lab

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository documents my hands-on experience in vulnerability research, exploitation, and mitigation, focusing on the **OWASP Top 10**.

---

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a cybersecurity student focused on understanding the "how" and "why" of security breaches to build more resilient systems. My goal is to bridge the gap between offensive techniques and defensive implementations.

## 🔬 Featured Lab: Web Vulnerability & Remediation
In this project, I developed a controlled environment (WSL, Apache, MariaDB) to test and fix critical web vulnerabilities.

### 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
* **Status:** ✅ Identified & Patched
* **Description:** Exploited a dynamic query to bypass authentication.
* **Mitigation:** Implemented **Prepared Statements** using PHP's `bind_param()` to neutralize the attack.

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* **Status:** ✅ Identified & Patched
* **Description:** Injected malicious JavaScript payloads to simulate session hijacking.
* **Mitigation:** Applied output encoding and input sanitization (htmlspecialchars).

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
* **Languages:** Python (Automation), Bash, PHP (Secure Coding).
* **Protocols & Networking:** TCP/IP, HTTP/S, DNS.
* **Defensive Tools:** Log Analysis, Firewall configuration, SIEM.
* **Offensive Tools:** Burp Suite, SQLmap, Nmap.
